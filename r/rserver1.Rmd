# RStudio Server Setup in VPN Part I 

The server is on Ubuntu and client is MacBook Pro

## Server Configuration
The configuration file is **/etc/rstudio/rserve.conf**
### Port and Address
```
www-port=6767
```
RStudio server will bind to address 0.0.0.0. 
> We'd better change this by adding **www-address** entry instead of accepting connections from any remote IP

```
www-address=127.0.0.1
```

## Server Administration

### Create RStudio User

### Start and Stop
```
$ sudo /usr/sbin/rstudio-server start
$ sudo /usr/sbin/rstudio-server restart
$ sudo /usr/sbin/rstudio-server stop
```

## Login 
```
http://127.0.0.1:6767
```

However, the server can only be connected from 127.0.0.1 in this example. In part II, I will set up VPN so that we can use RStudio Server from anywhere with better security.
