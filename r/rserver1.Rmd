# RStudio Server Setup in VPN Part I 

**RStudio** is a great IDE to use when using **R**. Recently I started to toy with **RStudio** server. My goal is to have **RStudio** server installed on Ubuntu box so that I can access my **R** from any computer in any location. That will be the biggest win.
It turns out the installation is miraculously easy. Although the details can be found [in the instructions provided on the web site](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/server/getting_started), I summarize the ins and outs of the whole process. 

## Download and Installation
It is rather straightforward. Just [follow this page](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/server) to download and install packages from different platforms. 

## Server Configuration
The configuration file is in **/etc/rstudio/rserver.conf**. The two important settings are below:

1. WWW Port 
  ```
   www-port=6767
  ```
       
2. WWW Address  
> **RStudio** server will bind to address 0.0.0.0. It is better to change this by adding **www-address** entry instead of accepting connections from any remote IP  
 
  ```
  www-address=127.0.0.1
  ```

## Server Administration

1. Create **RStudio** User
Once the server successfully installed, create a new user like so:

  ```
sudo useradd -d /home/ruser -m ruser
sudo passwd ruser
  ```
2. Start and Stop  

  ```
$ sudo /usr/sbin/rstudio-server start
$ sudo /usr/sbin/rstudio-server restart
$ sudo /usr/sbin/rstudio-server stop
  ```

## Login 
  All I had to do was to fire up a browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:6767`

## In Conclusion
After typing user name and password, what showed up on my browser was identical to the desktop version of **RStudio**. However, the server can only be connected from 127.0.0.1 in this example. In part II, I will set up [VPN(Virtual Private Network)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) so that I can access **RStudio** Server from anywhere.
